AF_INET is a non-local IPv4 connection, while AF_UNIX is for local communication.

SOCK_DGRAM is connectionless and less reliable, but fixed length; sends datagrams. SOCK_STREAM is a 2-way, reliable, internet-based connection.

4) Why is it important to clear all the values the addrinfo struct before using it in getaddrinfo?
Don't want garbage values in there.

5) What are ai_family and ai_socktype?
domain and socket type, respectively. First 2 arguments of socket().

6) What does getaddrinfo do?
Helper which sets addrinfo structs that contain Internet addresses to call via bind() or connect().

Connects a socket to an Internet address. For SOCK_STREAM (I think we use; TCP), this creates a connection.

8) What is setsockopt?
